#  Configuration details for urad sensor (change the values under [config] below
#  see also: uRAD - `User Manual SDK1.1 - USB - EN.pdf`
#
#  inputs - descriptions
#   - `mode`:
#      1 - continuous wave (dist=0.45m - 60m,meas=speed,38samp/sec)
#      2 - sawtooth wave   (dist=0.45m - 100m,meas=dist,21samp/sec)
#      3 - triangle wave   (dist=0.45m - 100m,speed&dist,13samp/sec)
#      4 - dual-rate wave  (dist=0.45m - 75m),speed&dist,7samp/sec)
#   - `f0` - operation frequency/ramp start frequency:  runs at 24.{f0} GHz, (eg if f0 = 38 => 24.038 GHz; if f0=121 => 24.121GHz, f0=5 => 24.005GHz)
#   - `BW` - operation bandwidth (minValue=50,maxBW=245-`f0`) , higher BW the better the accuracy (not used in mode 1)
#          * if operating in an area with lots of interferring signals try tweaking BW&f0 to get a distinct signal, reducing interference(page 7-8 of User Manual)
#   - `Ns` - number of samples to take of reflected wave to calculat dist/speed (range 50 -> 200), lower number = faster reads
#           * relation THEORETICAL_DIST_max = 75*(`Ns`/`BW`) is important (ie if Ns=50 & BW=250 => maxDist is only 15.625m; if Ns=200&BW=50 theoretical maxDist is 300m(not acheivable)
